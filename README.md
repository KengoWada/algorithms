# Algorithms

My journey learning some algorithms. Implementations will be in Python

## Search Algorithms

### Linear Search

This is the simplest search algorithm to implement.
You start from the extreme left of the array and compare
each element to your desired value.

If an matches, return it's index in the array. If no element
in the array matches the desired value, return -1.

This algorithm has a **Time Complexity of O(n)**. It is also
rarely used in the real world because it is not as efficient
as other search algorithms we are about to see.

### Binary Search
